Changes are welcome!

If you have developed a Silica mod and would like to add it to the table, file an Issue Feature Enhancement with the description and link to your mod. No closed-source mods will be accepted.

If you have minor fixes, submit a pull request with those changes. If the changes are major then it's best to coordinate on the Silica Discord (https://discord.gg/QAqhhkYmM7) before submitting the changes in a pull request.
